    Calculate thermal noise RMS per baseline per integration snapshot.

    Eqn 3 from Prelogovic+22 2107.00018 without the last sqrt term
    That eqn comes from converting Eqn 9 in Ghara+16 1511.07448
    that's a flux density [Jy] to temperature [mK],
    but without the assumption of a circular symmetry of antenna distribution.

    The result here is in temperature units, which requires knowing the
    pixel solid angle. This is calculated assuming the box has a transverse
    comoving length of `box_length` at the redshifts corresponding to `freqs`.

    The usual formula to convert from flux density (Jy)  to temperature involves only
    the beam area, but this assumes that the flux comes from a source that fills the
    beam. Here we scale this by the final pixel solid angle desired, which is frequency
    dependent, and assumes that the input is the same comoving size at all frequencies.

    This function integrates over the `lst_bin_size` of the observation at a resolution

    While this will compute the RMS of the thermal noise on a UV grid at any

    """Apply a wedge filter to a lightcone in uv space.

    This function computes the Fourier transform along the frequency axis
    in chunks of size `chunk_size`, and zeros all modes that fall into the wedge
    before Fourier-transforming back to frequency space.

    Note that we don't apply a frequency taper here. Frequency tapers are important
    if there really are foregrounds in the data, but are less important if the data
    is simply the cosmological signal + thermal noise. Furthermore, applying a frequency
    taper causes channels towards the edges to be significantly downweighted in the
    final filtered lightcone, which is not desirable.

    Note that there is no uniquely "correct" way to apply this wedge filter to
    a rectilinear lightcone such as is assumed in this function. This is because the
    wedge is naturally defined in (b, tau) space, where b is the baseline length
    and tau is the delay, the fourier dual of frequency *along a single baseline*.
    In other words, the correct modes to remove depends on redshift, but we only have
    a single slice at each redshift, and we can't do the line-of-sight FT of a single
    slice.

    We allow two methods to get the "approximate" wedge cut:

    1. A 'rolling' window approach, where a window of a specified is used to compute
       the FT, and the wedge is defined at the central frequency of the window, and the
       window is rolled along the frequency axis, so only one slice is changed at a
       time, each with a "correct" wedge cut. The downsides here are:
         - The slices at the edges of the lightcone must be dealt with specially, as
           they can't be central slices. Here, we set these via the chunk method (below)
         - The computational cost is higher, as the FT must be computed many times.
         - The slices are not independent, as each slice gets mixed in with its
           neighbours within the chunk. How exactly this effects the output lightcone
           with respect to the "true" wedge cut (or with respect to the second method
           below) is not clear.
    2. A 'chunk' approach, where the lightcone is split into independent chunks
       and the FT is computed for each chunk. The wedge is defined at the
       central frequency of each chunk, and all modes below the wedge are removed.
       This method should in principle yield the same power spectrum, within the chunks,
       as would be normally computed.
       The downsides here are:
         - The wedge is not precisely correct within each chunk, especially for the
           edge channels of the chunk.

    ----------
    uv_lightcones : astropy.units.Quantity

        If an int is provided, all chunks will have the same size.
        If an array is provided, it must have the same length as the number of chunks.
        If None, the entire lightcone is treated as a single chunk.

    antenna_effective_area : astropy.units.Quantity, optional
        Effective area of the antenna with shape (Nfreqs,).
    beam_area : astropy.units.Quantity, optional
        Beam area of the antenna with shape (Nfreqs,).
        Must only provide one of antenna_effective_area or beam_area.
    nsamples : int, optional
        Number of noise realisations to sample, by default 1.
    seed : int, optional
        Random seed for reproducibility, by default None.
    window_fnc : str, optional
        Name of window function to be applied to the noise sampled in uv space,
        by default windows.blackmanharris.
    min_nbls_per_uv_cell : int, optional
        Minimum number of baselines per uv cell to consider
        the cell to be measured, by default 1.
        Thermal noise in uv space is set to zero for
        uv cells with less than this number of baselines.
    remove_wedge : bool, optional
        If True, remove the wedge from the noisy lightcone,
        using wedge_kpar to determine the wedge boundary,
        by default False.
    wedge_kpar : callable, optional
        Function that takes kperp and returns the corresponding kpar
        below which modes are considered to be contaminated by foregrounds.
        By default, the horizon limit with no buffer is used.
    cosmo : astropy.cosmology, optional
        Cosmology to use, by default Planck18.
    wedge_chunk_size : int or np.ndarray, optional
        Number of slices per chunk used to perform wedge removal.
        See Prelogovic+23 page 4 step (i).
        If an int is provided, all chunks will have the same size.
        If an array is provided, it must have the same length as the number of chunks.
        Must be provided if remove_wedge is True.
    wedge_chunk_skip : int or np.ndarray, optional
        Number of redshift slices to skip between chunks.
        If not provided, independent cubic chunks are assumed
        with wedge_chunk_skip = wedge_chunk_size.
        If an int is provided, all chunks will be
        separated by the same number of slices.
